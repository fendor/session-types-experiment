--
-- This module provides synchronous channels.  Unlike the channels in
-- 'Control.Concurrent.Chan', which are unbounded queues on which
-- writers never block, these channels allow each writer to block until
-- it synchronizes with the particular reader that receives its message.
--
-- We actually provide three classes of channel operations:
--
--   [Synchronous, blocking] These operations block until they
--     synchronize their communication with another thread.
--
--   [Synchronous, non-blocking] These operations complete immediately
--     if another thread is ready to synchronize, and otherwise return
--     a failure code immediately.
--
--   [Asynchronous] These operations complete immediately and always
--     succeed, though the value they send may not be received until
--     another thread tries to receive it.

module Control.Concurrent.Chan.Synchronous (
  -- * The channel datatype
  Chan,               -- abstract: * -> *
  -- ** Construction and observation
    newChan,            -- IO (Chan a)
    isEmptyChan,        -- Chan a -> IO Bool

  -- * Synchronous, blocking operations
  -- | The synchronous, blocking channel operations are designed
  --   to complete only when a writing thread synchronizes with a
  --   reading thread.
  --
  --   They are exception safe, in the sense that if
  --   an asynchronous exception is delivered to a blocked thread,
  --   that thread is removed from the pool and cannot synchronize
  --   with another.  In particular, we can write code like this:
  --
  --   @
  --   'Control.Exception.block' $ do
  --     msg <- 'readChan' c
  --     'writeIORef' r msg
  --   @
  --
  --   In this case, the call to 'readChan' may be interrupted, but
  --   if the message is delivered, the 'writeIORef' will happen.  There
  --   is no case where the writing thread synchronizes and unblocks
  --   and the message is dropped on the floor.  This make it possible
  --   to safely implement features such as timeouts on blocking
  --   operations.

  -- ** Basic operations
    writeChan,          -- Chan a -> a -> IO ()
    readChan,           -- Chan a -> IO a
  -- ** Questionable operations
    unGetChan,          -- Chan a -> a -> IO ()
    swapChan,           -- Chan a -> a -> IO a
  -- ** List operations
    getChanContents,    -- Chan a -> IO [a]
    getChanN,           -- Chan a -> Integer -> IO [a]
    writeList2Chan,     -- Chan a -> [a] -> IO ()

  -- * Synchronous, non-blocking operations
  -- | These operations are similar to the blocking operations in that
  --   they only succeed by synchronizing with another thread, but
  --   they return a failure code rather than block if no other thread
  --   is ready or if they cannot acquire a lock on the channel.
  --
  --   Generally, a non-blocking operation from this section
  --   cannot synchronize with another non-blocking operation.  The
  --   other operation that pairs up with one of these operations will
  --   always be blocking or asynchronous.
  --
  --   These operations are designed to operate in constant time
  --   (or linear time for the list operations).
  --   In particular, it may be possible to attempt to synchronize with
  --   a waiting thread that gives up before the operation is complete.
  --   Rather than look for another opportunity, which could lead to
  --   an arbitrary number of attempts, the operation fails with
  --   'TryAgain'.

  -- ** The non-blocking result datatype
  TryResult(..),      -- concrete: * -> *
    maybeTry,           -- IO (TryResult a) -> IO (Maybe a)

  -- ** Basic operations
    tryWriteChan,       -- Chan a -> a -> IO (TryResult ()
    tryReadChan,        -- Chan a -> IO (TryResult a)
    tryPeekChan,        -- Chan a -> IO (TryResult a)
  -- ** List operations
    tryGetChanContents, -- Chan a -> IO (TryResult [a])
    tryGetChanN,        -- Chan a -> Integer -> IO (TryResult [a])
    tryWriteList2Chan,  -- Chan a -> Integer -> IO (TryResult (), [a])

  -- * Asynchronous operations
  -- | The asynchronous operations always succeed immediately.
  --   They should be semantically equivalent to forking another thread
  --   and performing the equivalent blocking operation (though they do
  --   not actually require a separate thread).

--- Chan representation

-- blocked thread is interrupted.
--
-- A reader contains an MVar in which to write a message to it, whereas
-- a writer contains the value it has sent and an MVar on which to
-- confirm receipt of the message.  A channel at any point in time is
-- represented as either a queue of waiting writers or a queue of
-- waiting readers.

  | NotReady
    -- | An attempt was made to synchronize with another thread, but
